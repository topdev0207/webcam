# webcam-capture-driver-jmf

This is driver containing video grabber for Webcam Capture project. It utilizes JMF 
capabilities to access
PC webcam (those USB-connected too) and can be used as a replacement for default 
build-in driver. Its advantage is the
fact it's pretty fast, but unformtunately, from the other hand, it requires 
**[JMF](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/download-142937.html)** to be 
installed on your PC.
