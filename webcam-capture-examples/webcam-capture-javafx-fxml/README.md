# JavaFX Example With Webcam Capture API

This simple example, generously provided by Rakesh Bhatt ([rakeshbhatt10](https://github.com/rakeshbhatt10)),
demonstrates how to use Webcam Capture API inside JavaFX application with 
scene constructed with FXML and simple WebcamController. 
FXML is not used at all and complete scene structure is composed directly 
in the Java code. For the FXML demonstration check other example. 

Original project can be found [here](https://github.com/rakeshbhatt10/WebCamJavaFXFXMLSample).

Thank you Rakesh!
