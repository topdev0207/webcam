# Webcam Capture Motion Detector Example

This is simple application illustrating of how to use build-in motion detector.
 
## Detect Motion

Detector use data from webcam and perform numeric analysis to decide if there 
is a motion, or there is none.

This sample application uses ```while / isMotion()``` approach (the second way
to use motion detector is listener approach). It display Me Gusta Guy when motion
has been detected and Forever Alone Guy when no motion has been detected. In this
example motion inertia is 1000 milliseconds.
