## Contribution

If you have spare time, knownledge or some small amount of money you 
can help developing 
awesome Webcam Capture API and make it even better! Several kinds of 
contributions are very welcome:

* **Report bug or feature** - If you've found a bug or you've came-up with some fantastic feature which 
can make Webcam Capture a better API to use, don't hesitate to 
[create new issue](https://github.com/sarxos/webcam-capture/issues/new) 
where you can describe in details what the problem is, or what would you
like to improve.
* **Perform tests** - Since Webcam Capture use some part of native code, it's very 
hard to cover all supported operating systems. I'm always testing it
on 64-bit Ubuntu Linux, Windows XP and Vista (both 32-bit), but I
have no possibility to test on Raspberry Pi, Mac OS and 32-bit Linux.
Please help and test on those systems if you have such possibility. 
* **Write code** - If you know Java or C++ you can help developing Webcam Capture by 
forking repository and sending pull requests.
* **Donate** - People have expressed a wish to donate a little money. Donating won't 
get you anything special, other than a warm feeling inside, and possibly 
urge me to produce more freely available material for Webcam Capture 
project. You can donate via PayPal, find _donate_ button available 
[here](http://webcam-capture.sarxos.pl/#contribute) on the project page.


## Hello World

Code below will capture image from your default webcam and save it in ```hello-world.png``` file:

```java
Webcam webcam = Webcam.getDefault();
webcam.open();
ImageIO.write(webcam.getImage(), "PNG", new File("hello-world.png"));
```

## More Examples

Below is the list of pretty basic examples. All can be found in the 
project source code. Please note that some of those examples are using 
the newest API which possibly has not yet been released. In such a case
please make sure you are using the newest Webcam Capture SNAPSHOT version.

## Capture Drivers

By default Webcam Capture use default driver which consists of small, refined
part of awesome [OpenIMAJ](http://sourceforge.net/p/openimaj/home/OpenIMAJ/) 
framework wrapped in thread-safe container which allows it to be used in 
multithreaded applications. 
However there are more ready-to-use drivers which can be used as a replacement 
or addition to the default one. By utilizing those drivers Webcam Capture can 
be extended with various new features (e.g. IP camera support).

List of additional drivers includes:

* [IP Camera Driver](https://github.com/sarxos/webcam-capture/tree/master/webcam-capture-drivers/webcam-capture-driver-ipcam) - available in Maven Central, adds IP / network cameras support
* [JMF Driver](https://github.com/sarxos/webcam-capture/tree/master/webcam-capture-drivers/webcam-capture-driver-jmf) - available in Maven Central, JMF replacement for default driver
* [OpenIMAJ Driver](https://github.com/sarxos/webcam-capture/tree/master/webcam-capture-drivers/webcam-capture-driver-openimaj) - **not** available in Maven Central, OpenIMAJ replacement for default driver
* [LTI-CIVIL Driver](https://github.com/sarxos/webcam-capture/tree/master/webcam-capture-drivers/webcam-capture-driver-lti-civil) - **not** available in Maven Central, Windows only, LTI-CIVIL replacement for default driver
* [OpenCV Driver](https://github.com/sarxos/webcam-capture/tree/master/webcam-capture-drivers/webcam-capture-driver-javacv) - **unstable**, OpenCV replacement for default driver
* [VLC Driver](https://github.com/sarxos/webcam-capture/tree/master/wwebcam-capture-drivers/ebcam-capture-driver-vlcj) - **unstable**, Linux only, VLC replacement for default driver

## History

I initially started working on Webcam Capture as a simple proof-of-concept after 
I read [Andrew Davison](http://fivedots.coe.psu.ac.th/~ad/)'s fantastic book entitled
[Killer Game Programming](http://www.amazon.com/Killer-Game-Programming-Andrew-Davison/dp/0596007302/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1360352393&sr=1-1&keywords=killer+game+programming)
(which is also available [online](http://fivedots.coe.psu.ac.th/~ad/jg/)). Thank you Andrew! 
Later I found that there is a complete mess in Java APIs allowing you to capture images
from webcams. Once you choose specific API you cannot change it without modifying 
large parts of the code. I decided to change this situation and write general purpose
wrapper for various different APIs (like JMF, OpenCV, OpenIMAJ, LTI-CIVIL, VLC).
In such a way, Webcam Capture as we know it today, was brought to life. Today you 
can change underlying frameworks just by replacing webcam driver (one line code 
change). If there is no driver for particular framework, it's very easy to write it
yourself.
